# HMAC
Hashed Message Authentication Code used to verify the integrity of the messages sent/received


<h1>Objectives â€“</h1> 
<ol>
<li>As the Hash Function, HMAC is also aimed to be one way, i.e, easy to generate output from input but complex the other way round. </li>
<li>It aims at being less affected by collisions than the hash functions. </li>
<li>HMAC reuses the algorithms like MD5 and SHA-1 and checks to replace the embedded hash functions with more secure hash functions, in case found. </li>
<li>HMAC tries to handle the Keys in a more simple manner. </li>
</ol>
